my weather app is an interactive web application that provides real-time weather updates based on user input. It includes a user authentication system where users can register and log in with a username and password, which are stored in local storage. After logging in, users can enter a city name to fetch live weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and overall conditions like sunny, rainy, cloudy, or snowy.

A standout feature of the app is its dynamic background, which changes automatically based on the weather. If it’s sunny, a bright sky video plays; if it’s raining, a rain animation appears, and similar effects apply for cloudy and snowy weather. This enhances user experience by making the interface visually engaging. However, the login and registration pages maintain a static background for a clean and professional look.

The app has a user-friendly design with intuitive navigation and a responsive layout. It supports the "Enter" key function, allowing users to fetch weather updates instantly without clicking a button. The weather data is fetched from the WeatherAPI service, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

To improve functionality, the app could be upgraded with features such as storing user preferences, displaying a five-day forecast, integrating Google Maps API for automatic location detection, and transitioning from local storage to a secure SQL-based database. This would enhance security and data management.

Overall, this weather app combines real-time data with an engaging UI, making weather updates interactive and visually appealing. It provides a seamless experience with modern design elements, making it not just informative but also enjoyable for users# weather-app
